# Preface: Nobita's Resolution

It's me, Nobita.

If you're here, you probably know me. I'm the one who's always messing things up, getting bullied by Gian, and then running home crying for Doraemon to help me out.

And he always does. With a gadget from his amazing 4D pocket, any problem seems to vanish. The "Anywhere Door" can get me out of a tight spot, and the "Time-Kerchief" can turn a bad situation around.

But I've started to realize something. Just having the gadgets isn't enough.

How many times have I used a gadget without reading the instructions, only to make things worse? How often do I rely on them to fix a problem, without learning how to avoid the problem in the first place?

That's going to change.

This is my journal. My personal log of every gadget Doraemon has given me. I'm going to study each one. I want to understand how they work, when to use them, and—most importantly—when *not* to. I want to learn to face Gian on my own.

The following chapters are my notes. They might be clumsy, and they might be full of mistakes, but they're mine. It's the story of my resolution to finally grow up and master these tools.

I hope they can help you, too.

Let the journey begin.
